# Token-Backed Learning Contracts for Students

## Description
This project implements a smart contract on the Aptos blockchain to support student learning through token-backed incentives. The contract allows students to register with an initial token balance and redeem earned tokens for educational rewards. The goal is to encourage students to engage in learning activities while leveraging blockchain transparency and security.

## Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized education reward system that fosters student engagement and motivation. By integrating blockchain-based incentives, students can earn tokens based on their learning progress, which can then be redeemed for educational resources, certifications, or other benefits.

## Future Scope
- **Automated Reward System:** Introduce an automated grading and reward mechanism based on learning performance.
- **Integration with E-Learning Platforms:** Enable seamless connection with online courses and learning management systems.
- **NFT-Based Certifications:** Issue blockchain-based certificates as NFTs upon course completion.
- **Token Marketplace:** Create a marketplace where students can trade earned tokens for educational content, books, or mentorship programs.
